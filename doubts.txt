Doubts and things to try by yourself
-   Read from file or long string in go
-   2D Array declarations
-   System Args
-   Purpose of uni-directional channels


Notes:
-   When Passing array to a function make slice of it as you are constrained to pass length 
    as well while declaring the parameter in the function definition
-   Everything is pass by value in Go unless passed using pointer reference
-   A bi-directional channel can be passed to a function that takes send-only or receive-only channels, 
    but the reverse is not true.
