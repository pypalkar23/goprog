Doubts and things to try by yourself
-Read from file or long string in go
-2D Array declarations
-System Args


Notes:
-When Passing array to a function make slice of it as you are constrained to pass length 
 as well while declaring the parameter in the function definition
-Everything is pass by value in Go unless passed using pointer reference
